# Plan — wedge & slices

## Changelog

- 2026-07-10 — v1 of plan, from founding design session. Wedge chosen: drift
  attribution. Executor strategy: tfplugin direct, no TF/OpenTofu/Pulumi engines.
- 2026-07-10 — Slice 1 revised from tfplugin v6-only to dual v5/v6. Real
  provider binaries (terraform-provider-aws 6.54.0, terraform-provider-time
  0.9.2) were found to serve v5 on the wire regardless of what protocol
  version a client requests — v6-only would not have worked against any
  current real provider. See docs/architecture.md — Execution layer, and
  STATE.md for the empirical finding. provider/ now exposes one
  protocol-agnostic interface backed by tfplugin5 and tfplugin6 wire
  implementations, version selected from the handshake.

## Strategy

**Wedge:** drift attribution on existing Terraform/OpenTofu repos.
Pitch: *"Your infra changed outside of code. Here's who, when — and a signed
record of what you decided about it."*
Delivery: CLI + (later) GitHub App. Zero migration required; every resolved drift
appends to a ledger, installing the proposal format as a side effect.

**Success criteria (month 6):** ~10 teams running against real prod accounts.
Thesis metric: % of surfaced drifts resolved through the signed flow —
>60% validates proposals as the unit of change; <20% falsifies cheaply.

## Foundational slices (~2-3 weeks each, end-to-end, ugly, real)

### Slice 1 — talk to one provider
- Launch AWS provider binary, tfplugin handshake (dual v5/v6, version
  negotiated from the handshake — see changelog)
- GetProviderSchema; dump one resource type's schema
- ReadResource against one real AWS resource
- Exit: attributed real-world read in a single CLI command

### Slice 2 — trust core
- Hand-written proposal JSON (no SDK/chat) → canonical hash → `ubx accept`
  (local signing) → ledger append → `ubx why` reads it back
- Exit: schema.md hashing rules ratified; first real ledger exists

### Slice 3 — close the loop (wedge skeleton)
- `ubx scan`: provider reality vs ledger → drift detected
- Drift → adoption proposal generated → accept → ledger updated → `why` explains
- Exit: the demo — point at a messy account, resolve a drift with a signed record

## Wedge buildout (months 1–6)

- **M1–2 (detection core):** top ~50 AWS resource types via ReadResource;
  CloudTrail correlation (drift → actor, timestamp, session); `scan`,
  `status --drift`. Milestone: attributed drift on a real messy account in <5 min.
- **M3–4 (decision loop):** adopt/revert proposals signed via PR-merge or CLI;
  adopt writes corrected attributes back to existing .tf files (narrow-scope
  bidirectionality); revert emits plan — apply via the team's own tooling at this
  stage (executor trust comes later). GitHub App surfaces drift as issue/PR with
  receipt.
- **M5–6 (retention layer):** `why` over drift history, Slack notifications,
  policy stubs (auto-adopt sandbox / require-approval prod).

## Deferred (explicitly not now)

SDK + codegen, chat/intent provider, diagrams, markdown intents, full executor
(ApplyResourceChange path), policies beyond stubs, environments/promotion,
Nexus SaaS, naming of proposal ledger format for external publication.

## Risks being managed

- Category creation cost → wedge is findable pain ("terraform drift"), not a new
  concept to explain.
- Solo-founder scope → slices are small, sellable, compounding; giants ignore
  narrow wedges.
- Executor trust → deferred; wedge reads and records before it ever writes.
  Adversarial reliability testing becomes the credibility engine when the
  executor lands (publish results, Jepsen-style).
