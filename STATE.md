# STATE.md — living project state

> Updated as the last act of every working session. This file is the handoff.

## Current phase

**Slice 1, done.** `provider/` package speaks tfplugin v5 AND v6 (protocol
negotiated from the handshake), through one protocol-agnostic `Provider`
interface. GetProviderSchema, Configure, and ReadResource are all verified
end-to-end against the real `terraform-provider-aws` 6.54.0 binary in
Roozbeh's own AWS account (bucket `ubx-states`, read-only) — see Surprises
below for the two empirical findings that shaped this. Fully covered by
adversarial tests against fake plugin binaries (both protocols).

## Current focus

Slice 1 exit criteria are met (schema dump + real ReadResource). Next up is
Slice 2 (trust core) per docs/plan.md, unless Roozbeh wants a dev-facing CLI
verb for provider interaction first (see Next steps).

## Open decisions

- [ ] Provider binary acquisition: download from registry.terraform.io with
      signature verification vs. vendored for dev
- [ ] Go module path final confirmation (`github.com/ubiquex/ubiquex-cli`)
- [x] **RESOLVED 2026-07-10 — protocol v6-only premise.** Decision: dual-protocol
      client. `provider/` now has tfplugin5 and tfplugin6 wire implementations
      behind one `Provider` interface, version selected from the handshake.
      docs/architecture.md and docs/plan.md updated accordingly. See Done below
      for what shipped.
- [x] **RESOLVED 2026-07-10 — canonical hashing serialization format.**
      docs/schema.md §Canonical hashing is now RATIFIED v1: SHA-256 over
      canonical JCS-style JSON, domain prefix `ubx:proposal:v1\n`, hash
      excludes exactly `id`/`acceptance`/`status`, numbers restricted to
      int64/decimal-strings (floats rejected at propose time), delta arrays
      sorted lexicographically by `(stack, type, name)`, intent.sources carry
      content hashes. Any further change requires a schema_version bump.

## Done

- 2026-07-10: Repo founded. CLAUDE.md, STATE.md, docs/ (architecture, schema v0.1,
  plan, prompts) written from the v2 design session.
- 2026-07-10: Go module (`github.com/ubiquex/ubiquex-cli`) initialized. Cobra CLI
  skeleton added: `cmd/ubx/main.go` entrypoint, `cli/root.go` root command,
  `cli/version.go` (`ubx version`, `Version` var overridable via ldflags). Tests
  in `cli/version_test.go` and `cli/root_test.go`, all green (`go build ./...`,
  `go vet ./...`, `go test ./...`).
- 2026-07-10: Slice 1 first cut — `provider/` package, tfplugin v6-only. (Superseded
  same day by the dual-protocol refactor below, once real binaries turned out
  not to speak v6 — see Surprises.)
- 2026-07-10: Slice 1 completed — dual-protocol `provider/` package.
  - `provider/tfplugin5/`, `provider/tfplugin6/`: both proto files vendored
    verbatim from `github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-go@v0.31.0` (per
    those files' own "copy this into your codebase" instruction), Go/gRPC
    stubs generated via protoc + protoc-gen-go + protoc-gen-go-grpc.
  - `provider/handshake.go`: parses the go-plugin handshake line. Magic
    cookie, core protocol version (1), verified against terraform-plugin-go's
    server source. App protocol version is no longer hardcoded to 6 — any
    version in `supportedAppProtocolVersions` (5, 6) is accepted, and
    `Launch` advertises both via `PLUGIN_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS` so a
    dual-protocol-capable plugin can pick the best mutually supported one.
  - `provider/provider.go`: protocol-agnostic `Provider` interface
    (`ProtocolVersion`, `Schema`, `Configure`, `ReadResource`) with two
    backing implementations, `v5Provider`/`v6Provider`, chosen by
    `newProvider(negotiatedVersion, conn)`. Callers never branch on protocol
    version.
  - `provider/schema.go`: protocol-agnostic `Schemas`/`Schema`/`Block`/
    `Attribute`/`NestedBlock` types, translated from either wire protocol's
    generated structs. Nested blocks are modeled recursively (not flattened)
    — required for real provider config encoding, see Surprises.
  - `provider/ctyvalue.go`: encodes/decodes DynamicValue payloads as
    cty-msgpack (via `github.com/zclconf/go-cty`, MIT-licensed — the same
    library the Terraform ecosystem itself uses for this), building the cty
    object type from a Block (attributes + nested blocks, recursively).
    ubx's own callers see plain JSON in/out; the cty/msgpack machinery is
    entirely internal.
  - `provider/client.go`: `Launch` now negotiates protocol version from the
    handshake and builds the matching `Provider`. Also raised the gRPC
    message size limit to 256MiB (`maxProviderMessageSize`, matching
    `grpcMaxMessageSize` in tf5server/tf6server) — the real AWS provider's
    full schema dump exceeds gRPC's 4MiB default.
  - `provider/internal/fakeprovider/`: fixture binary extended to serve
    either protocol (`ok-v5`/`ok-v6` modes) with a real gRPC server, plus a
    real ReadResource implementation that decodes/re-encodes cty-msgpack
    (not just echoing bytes) so the round trip is genuinely exercised.
    `unsupported-version` mode (reports app protocol 4) replaces the old
    `bad-app` mode, which reported v5 — no longer wrong now that v5 is
    supported.
  - Tests: `handshake_test.go` covers version-negotiation edge cases (v5
    accepted, v6 accepted, unsupported versions 4/7/99 rejected, non-numeric
    version malformed). `client_test.go` covers Launch happy-path for both
    protocols (schema dump + a real ReadResource round trip through cty
    encoding) plus all adversarial paths (binary missing, handshake timeout,
    core/app/wire protocol mismatch, malformed line, plugin exits early). All
    green (`go build ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `go test ./...`).
  - **Real-world verification** (manual harness, not part of the automated
    suite — same pattern used for the schema-dump verification last
    session): downloaded `terraform-provider-aws` 6.54.0 (darwin_arm64) and
    ran the full sequence — Launch → negotiated v5 → GetProviderSchema
    (1682 resource types) → Configure (region=us-east-1) → ReadResource
    against the real S3 bucket `ubx-states` in Roozbeh's own AWS account,
    using his already-configured `~/.aws/credentials`. Got back a fully
    populated, real bucket state (arn, region, versioning, server-side
    encryption config, grants, etc.) — a real, read-only, attributed-in-spirit
    infrastructure read via ubx's own protocol client, no Terraform/OpenTofu
    involved. This satisfies Slice 1's ReadResource exit bullet.

## Next steps

1. A `ubx provider ...` dev-facing CLI verb was again deliberately NOT added
   — still not part of the eventual product CLI surface (see
   docs/architecture.md component map), and Slice 1 didn't require it; the
   real-world ReadResource proof used a throwaway manual Go harness instead
   (not committed — see Surprises for what it did). Revisit once the CLI
   verb surface itself is being designed.
2. Begin Slice 2 (trust core) per docs/plan.md: hand-written proposal JSON →
   canonical hash → `ubx accept` (local signing) → ledger append → `ubx why`
   reads it back. This is also where the canonical hashing open decision
   above must finally get resolved — it's explicitly called out as
   blocking in docs/schema.md.
3. Not addressed this session, deliberately out of scope: CloudTrail
   attribution (M1-2 milestone, not a Slice 1 bullet), PlanResourceChange/
   ApplyResourceChange (write path — explicitly deferred per
   docs/architecture.md "wedge reads and records before it ever writes"),
   AutoMTLS (still opt-in/unimplemented, see provider/client.go — real
   provider binaries fall back to plaintext over the local unix socket
   without it, which is what ubx relies on).

## Surprises / findings

- 2026-07-10: **docs/architecture.md's "protocol v6 only" premise did not
  hold against real provider binaries.** Downloaded and tested two official
  HashiCorp binaries directly (env vars + raw exec, not through ubx, to rule
  out a bug on our side): `terraform-provider-aws` 6.54.0 and
  `terraform-provider-time` 0.9.2 (a pure terraform-plugin-framework
  provider, no SDKv2) both report `1|5|unix|...|grpc` — v5 — even when the
  client explicitly requests v6 via `PLUGIN_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS`. Traced into
  go-plugin's own `protocolVersion()` negotiation (server.go): a requested
  version only wins if the server actually registered it; neither binary
  registers v6 at all in the tested builds. Resolved this session: dual
  v5/v6 client (see Done above); docs/architecture.md and docs/plan.md
  updated with the finding and the decision.
- 2026-07-10: **Real providers require cty-msgpack, not the DynamicValue
  JSON field, for Configure/ReadResource request payloads.** A
  JSON-encoded provider config produced an immediate `EOF` diagnostic from
  terraform-provider-aws — consistent with an SDKv2-vintage decoder handed
  zero bytes because it only ever reads the msgpack field. Switched to
  encoding all requests as cty-msgpack via `github.com/zclconf/go-cty`
  (MIT), decoding responses the same way (preferring msgpack, falling back
  to json if a provider ever populates it).
- 2026-07-10: **Nested schema blocks aren't optional to model, even for a
  "just read one resource" milestone.** Sending a cty object built only from
  a schema's flat `attributes` (ignoring `block_types`) got a hard rejection
  from terraform-provider-aws: `"an object with 35 attributes is required
  (30 given)"`. A real provider's own decoded object type includes one
  attribute per nested block (object/list/set/map of the nested block's own
  type, depending on nesting mode) — ubx's `Schema`/`Block` model and
  `blockObjectType` now handle this recursively.
- 2026-07-10: **gRPC's 4MiB default message size is too small for a real
  provider schema dump.** AWS's full `GetProviderSchema` response is
  ~7MiB. Real provider binaries configure a 256MiB server-side limit
  (`grpcMaxMessageSize` in tf5server/tf6server); ubx's client now matches it.
- 2026-07-10: **ReadResource needs the resource's `id` in current_state, not
  just its natural-language identifier.** For `aws_s3_bucket`, sending only
  `{"bucket": "..."}` got back a null state (provider's Read function
  couldn't find anything to read); sending `{"id": "...", "bucket": "..."}`
  worked. SDKv2-style Read functions key off the state's `id` attribute
  specifically. Relevant for whatever builds import/adoption proposals later
  (docs/architecture.md's Import concept) — the resource ID convention is
  per-resource-type and not always the same attribute name.
