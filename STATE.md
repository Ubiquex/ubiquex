## In flight

Nothing currently in flight. UBI-196 and UBI-197 both closed this session --
see `HISTORY.md` for the full arc (docs corpus bindings_status reconciled
against real published packages for resources and data sources both, all six
`ubx-sdk-<provider>` packages regenerated/republished carrying real
`DataSourceBinding`, real generation provenance built into `ubx sdk gen` and
propagated into all six repos' CI and the docs pipeline).

**UBI-197's own root cause, found in a later pass and fixed**: the 908 of
1,400 held-back data-source pages classified as "miscategorized resource"
(a real `ResourceBinding` wire sitting under the docs corpus's `/data/`
directory) were never a docs-pipeline bug -- `gen_all_data_source_pages.py`
structurally cannot write a `ResourceBinding` wire under `/data/` (gates on
the real Go source's own `ubx.DataSourceBinding` marker). The real cause:
`ubiquex-docs`' generation needs two separate `ubx sdk gen` invocations per
provider (`--dump-ir` for schema.json, `--lang go --out` for the real Go
source), and both used to independently live-fetch each provider's
`schema_url` on every launch -- unpinned. If the real upstream spec changed
between the two fetches (confirmed live for Azure, whose spec sits on a
moving branch tip), the two invocations could disagree on which wires are
resources vs. data sources. **Fixed**: `sdk/providers/.ubx/config` switched
all six providers from live `schema_source`/`schema_url` entries to pinned
`source`/`version` entries against each provider's real, already-published
`ubx-schema-<name>` snapshot (`b40beb2`, pushed to `ubiquex` main). Verified
live: zero disagreement between the two invocations for any of the 13,458
real types (resources + data sources) across all six providers, post-switch.
This also collapsed `sdk/providers/.ubx/config` from 998 `[dynamic_providers.*]`
entries (302 for Azure alone) down to 6 -- one pinned entry per provider.

**UBI-198 filed, not built**: a real, separate, smaller-scale bug found
while diagnosing the above -- candidate discovery (`resourcemap.
DiscoverDataSources`, openapi source) treats any unclaimed GET as a
data-source candidate with no check for whether the response schema is a
genuine top-level operation response vs. a reusable, nested-only schema
component. Confirmed via direct $ref-reachability analysis against real
provider specs: 228/229 (99.6%) of Datadog's remaining held-back wires and
17/20 (85%) of GitHub's match a real component that's never a real
operation's own top-level response anywhere in the spec -- these pages
should not exist at all, not be regenerated. Azure's own check was
inconclusive (its wire-type derivation goes through an extra namespace-
splitting transform a plain snake-case match doesn't replicate) -- named as
follow-up in the ticket, not resolved. Two individual exceptions found
(`datadog_security_monitoring_rule_response`, `github_repository`/
`github_minimal_repository`/`github_visual_studio_subscription_assignment`)
need their own look before any bulk deletion.

Real, named follow-up work, not yet started:

- **Field-level content staleness**, found live this session, distinct from
  wire-naming divergence: even a data-source page whose wire type genuinely
  resolves can have example field values that no longer match the real
  current schema (real, live example: kubernetes singular lookups whose real
  `Config` struct is now empty, but old pages still show list-style
  pagination fields). Affected 423 pages this session, held back from the
  publish flip. No systematic fix built — would need real field data from a
  fresh `--dump-ir` per affected page, not just import-path patching.
- `--dump-ir`'s own `schema.json` could carry per-language identifiers
  directly, so `ubiquex-docs`' generators stop needing a full separate
  `--lang go --out` run just to recover them — would collapse each real
  batch to one `ubx sdk gen` invocation instead of two, closing the
  disagreeing-commit provenance failure mode at the root instead of only
  detecting it.
- Resource-side doubling correction (a real, different bug from the
  data-source naming divergence): `ubiquex-docs`' own `gcp_corrected_key`/
  `azure_corrected_wire` (`build_regen_schema.py`) and a second,
  differently-behaving copy of `gcp_corrected_key` (`gap_fill_apply.py`) are
  now almost entirely dead code against fresh dumps (`typename.Combine` in
  `ubx-provider-dynamic` already fixed this upstream) — retiring them needs
  pairing with a redirect pass for the already-published corpus's real mix
  of corrected/uncorrected paths.
- UBI-194: publish and acquire `ubx-provider-dynamic` for the other five
  providers (kubernetes already done) — recommendation on record is to wait
  for natural regeneration rather than forcing a metadata-only republish.

## Blocked

Nothing currently blocked.

## Before touching anything

- Never trust a "published"/"live" claim for a shared runtime or per-provider
  bindings repo from this monorepo's own state alone — verify against the real,
  separate repo/registry directly: a real `git log`/`diff` against the actual
  separate repo, or a real registry query (the Go module proxy, `jsr.io`,
  `pypi.org`), never infer "published" from a commit to the monorepo's own
  copy alone (CLAUDE.md rule 8). Same discipline for a branch with an open
  PR: confirm it's still open before pushing more commits to it.
- `ubx sdk gen` against a `[dynamic_providers.<name>]`/group source now warns
  (or, with `--require-clean-provenance`, refuses) when `ubx-provider-dynamic`'s
  local checkout is dirty or unpushed, and stamps real provenance into
  `--dump-ir` output and `--out`/`PROVENANCE.json` — do not assume a real
  generation's output is trustworthy without checking that stamp first,
  especially for anything meant to be committed or published.
- `docs/plan.md` and `docs/architecture.md` are the design-decision record for
  `ubiquex` itself; this file is not a substitute for either.
- `sdk/providers/.ubx/config` now pins all six providers (`source`/`version`
  against each real, published `ubx-schema-<name>` snapshot) instead of
  live-fetching `schema_url` -- a `--dynamic-provider-bin`/
  `UBX_PROVIDER_DYNAMIC_REPO`-built binary is still required (the pinned
  branch under `[dynamic_providers.<name>]`, unlike `[providers.<name>]`'s
  own `ubx resolve` path, does not yet resolve its own binary via
  `provider.AcquireDynamicProviderBinary`). A provider without a real
  published snapshot yet goes back to the live `schema_source`/`schema_url`
  shape -- see the config file's own top-of-file comment before adding one.

## Cross-repo state

`ubiquex` is the coordinating repo — this section is its responsibility to keep
current, not any other repo's own `STATE.md`. Verified directly (`gh api`), not
carried forward from memory, as of 2026-08-27/28.

**Schema repos** (`ubx-schema-<provider>`, real `manifest.json` + `members/`
group snapshots consumed via `provider.AcquireSchema`):

| Repo | Latest release | Carries real `min_binary_version`? |
|---|---|---|
| kubernetes | v3.0.1 | yes (`1.0.1`) |
| datadog | v1.0.0 | no — bootstrap fallback |
| azure | v1.0.0 | no — bootstrap fallback |
| google | v1.0.0 | no — bootstrap fallback |
| github | v1.0.0 | no — bootstrap fallback |
| aws | v1.0.0 | no — bootstrap fallback |

**`ubx-provider-dynamic`**: latest release `v1.0.1`, published per platform
with checksums, acquired via `provider.AcquireDynamicProviderBinary` — no
`UBX_PROVIDER_DYNAMIC_REPO` checkout required on the normal path.

**Shared runtimes** (not provider-specific — every one of the six providers
depends on all three):

| Repo | Package | Latest real version | Registry |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ubx-sdk-go` | `github.com/ubiquex/ubx-sdk-go` | `v0.2.0` | Go proxy (no CI, tags cut manually) |
| `ubx-sdk-typescript` | `@ubx/sdk` | `1.0.1` on npm, `0.1.2` on JSR | npm is real/current; JSR is frozen, not the six providers' own dependency target anymore |
| `ubx-sdk-python` | `ubx_sdk` | `0.2.0` | PyPI (no CI, published manually) |

All three verified to carry `DataSourceBinding` by downloading and
inspecting the real published artifact, not just querying the registry's
version number.

**SDK repos** (`ubx-sdk-<provider>`, three languages per repo) — latest
real version per repo, verified directly against PyPI/npm/the Go module
proxy:

| Repo | PyPI | npm | Go |
|---|---|---|---|
| kubernetes | 1.1.0 | 1.1.0 | v1.1.0 |
| github | 1.2.0 | 1.2.0 | v1.2.0 |
| datadog | 1.2.0 | 1.2.0 | v1.2.0 |
| azure | 1.1.0 | 1.1.0 | v1.1.0 |
| google | 1.2.0 | 1.2.0 | v1.2.0 |
| aws | 2.1.0 | 2.1.0 | v2.1.0 (module path `/v2`) |

All six confirmed to carry real `DataSourceBinding` content (downloaded and
inspected the real published artifact, not inferred from the version number
alone). Every one migrated `deno.json`/`package.json` from `jsr:@ubx/sdk` to
`npm:@ubx/sdk`, and `hash-watch.yml` now passes `--require-clean-provenance`
and commits a real `PROVENANCE.json`.

**Open PRs across the org**: none as of the last check this session — every
PR opened this session (`ubx-sdk-typescript#9` included) has been merged.
